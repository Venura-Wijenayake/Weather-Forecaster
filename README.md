App Title: City-Weather-Forecaster.

The City-Weather-Forecaster application uses openweatherAPI to gather real time weather data in a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate interface.
The application is capable of gathering the current forecast, an hourly forecast of the next 5 hours, a daily forecast for the next 5 days and the current local time using a javascript library called luxon.
The application also allows users to add their favourite cities to a tracker page, which requires storing the information on a mongoose database and being able to retrieve it. 

Whether you're a traveler, a commuter, or simply curious about the weather, the City-Weather-Forecaster application equips you with the tools you need to make informed decisions and stay weather-ready.
